**PONG**

**Description:**
Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games, first released in 1972 by Atari.
It is a two player game based on table tennis. It consists of two paddles used to
return a bouncing ball back and forth across the screen.
**Rules**:
• The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the
left or right side of the screen.
• They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on
the opposing side.
• Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.
• The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent;
points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
• The player reaching the eleven points first wins the game.
